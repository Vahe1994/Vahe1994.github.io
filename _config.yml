  Iâ€™m a fourth year PhD student at Skoltech.My research interests are shape reconstruction, geometry processing and generative networks. Main direction  of my research is dedicated to the vector graphics reconstruction from 2d (raster images) or 3d (points clouds) data. Other than shape reconstruction, I'm also doing research in the generative neural networks field.. During my PhD I published several papers at top Machine Learning conferences -  NeurIPS, ICLR, SiGGRAPH, ICCV, ECCV e.t.c. 
          In 2020, I was honoured to receive the Ilya Segalovich Award for Young Researchers.

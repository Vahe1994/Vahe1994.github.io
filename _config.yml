  Iâ€™m a fourth year PhD student at Skoltech.My research interests are shape reconstruction, geometry processing and generative networks. My research is dedicated to the vector graphics reconstruction from 2d and 3d data.I'm also doing research in the generative neural networks field. During my PhD I published several papers at top Machine Learning conferences -  SiGGRAPH,ECCV,NeurIPS,ICLR,e.t.c.

We propose Deep Estimators of Features (DEFs), a learning-based framework for predicting sharp geometric features in sampled 3D shapes. Differently from existing data-driven methods, which reduce this problem to feature classification, we propose to regress a scalar field representing the distance from point samples to the closest feature line on local patches. We demonstrate a downstream application, where we reconstruct an explicit representation of straight and curved sharp feature lines from range scan data.

We present a novel neural-networks-based algorithm to compute optimal transport (OT) plans and maps for general cost functionals. The algorithm is based on a saddle point reformulation of the OT problem and generalizes prior OT methods for weak and strong cost functionals. As an application, we construct a functional to map data distributions with preserving the class-wise structure of data.

[Wasserstein Iterative Networks for Barycenter Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12245)  
Korotin, A., Egiazarian, V., Li, L., Burnaev E.  
[Pre-print 2022] 

<img src="images/w2bar.png?raw=true"/>

In this paper, we present an algorithm to approximate the Wasserstein-2 barycenters of continuous measures via a generative model. In addition, based on the celebrity faces dataset, we construct Ave, celeba! dataset which can be used for quantitative evaluation of barycenter algorithms.

Korotin, A., Egiazarian, V., Asadulaev, A., Burnaev E.    
[ICLR 2021] 

<img src="images/w2gn_header.jpg?raw=true"/>

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end algorithm for training generative models which optimizes a non-minimax objective simplifying model training. The proposed algorithm uses the approximation of Wasserstein-2 distance by using Input Convex Neural Networks.

[Deep Vectorization of Technical Drawings](http://adase.group/3ddl/projects/vectorization/)  
Egiazarian,V.* , Voynov, O.* , Artemov, A., Volkhonskiy, D., Safin, A., Taktasheva, M., Zorin, D., & Burnaev, E.  
[ECCV 2020] 

<img src="images/deep_vect.png?raw=true"/>

We present a new method for vectorization of technical line drawings which consists of (1) a deep learning-based cleaning stage, (2) a transformer-based network to estimate vector primitives, and (3) an optimization procedure to obtain the final primitive configurations.

[Pyramids for Adversarial Representation Learning with 3D Point Clouds](http://adase.group/3ddl/projects/3d-laplatgan/)  
Egiazarian, V.* , Ignatyev, S.* , Artemov, A., Voynov, O., Kravchenko, A., Zheng, Y., Velho,L., Burnaev,E.  
[VISAPP 2020] 

<img src="images/latent_space.jpg?raw=true"/>

We employ a latent-space Laplacian pyramid representation within a hierarchical generative model for 3D point clouds. We combine recent latent-space GAN and Laplacian GAN to form a multi-scale model for generation of 3D point clouds with gradually increasing levels of detail.

[Beyond Vector Spaces: Compact Data Representation as Differentiable Weighted Graphs](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8914-beyond-vector-spaces-compact-data-representation-as-differentiable-weighted-graphs)  
Denis Mazur*, Vage Egiazarian*, Stanislav Morozov*, Artem Babenko  
[NeuRips 2019] 

<img src="images/graph_emb_classification.png?raw=true"/>

In this paper, we aim to eliminate the inductive bias imposed by the embedding space geometry. Namely, we propose to map data into more general non-vector metric spaces: a weighted graph with a shortest path distance. By design, such graphs can model arbitrary geometry with a proper configuration of edges and weights.

[Perceptual deep depth super-resolution](http://adase.group/3ddl/projects/perceptual-depth-sr/)  
Voinov, O., Artemov, A., Egiazarian, V., Notchenko, A., Bobrovskikh, G., Zorin, D., & Burnaev, E.    
[ICCV 2019] 

<img src="images/ddsr.jpg?raw=true"/>

We address the problem of depth map super-resolution with the focus on visual quality of the corresponding 3D geometry. We demonstrate that basing the loss function on deviation of 3D surface rendering instead of direct depth deviation yields significantly improved results as measured by a number of perceptual metrics.

### PROJECTS
**Telegram bot for Celebrity Faces**  
I was a part of a team working on implementing an algorithm for finding similar faces in Celebrity photo database by using Locality-sensitive hashing and Neural Network.  

**Spam Detector**   
Analysis and classification of Twitter accounts into 3 groups – “person”, “spam”, and “other”. A Telegram bot was created, to classify accounts in the above way, by using a combination of XGBoost and Neural Network classifiers.  

**Research Assistant, DSSLab, project ICS RAS**    
As part of a team completed the project “Conceptual structuring of the situation of building basic models of political and socio-economic situation of the Republic of Kazakhstan”. The work was done in the interest of the presidential administration of the Republic of Kazakhstan. February 2015 - April 2015  

**Mathematical modeling and investment planning for oil production**  
 In this paper, I developed a model for constructing an optimal investment portfolio for an oil company from a pool of projects. The objective was to maximize the NPV for 20 years. As a solution, a C# application was created using genetic algorithms with modifications to fit the needs of a particular problem.

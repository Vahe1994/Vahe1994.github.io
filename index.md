### PROJECTS
#### Telegram bot for Celebrity Faces   
I was a part of a team working on implementing an algorithm for finding similar faces in Celebrity photo database by using Locality-sensitive hashing and Neural Network.
#### Spam Detector  
Analysis and classification of Twitter accounts into 3 groups – “person”, “spam”, and “other”. A Telegram bot was created, to classify accounts in the above way, by using a combination of XGBoost and Neural Network classifiers.
#### Research Assistant, DSSLab, project ICS RAS  
As part of a team completed the project “Conceptual structuring of the situation of building basic models of political and socio-economic situation of the Republic of Kazakhstan”. The work was done in the interest of the presidential administration of the Republic of Kazakhstan. February 2015 - April 2015
#### Mathematical modeling and investment planning for oil production
 In this paper, I developed a model for constructing an optimal investment portfolio for an oil company from a pool of projects. The objective was to maximize the NPV for 20 years. As a solution, a C# application was created using genetic algorithms with modifications to fit the needs of a particular problem.
